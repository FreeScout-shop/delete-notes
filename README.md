<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Delete Notes Module allows FreeScout users to delete their own notes, a feature that has been mentioned before, but was never implemented into FreeScout.

In order to delete notes, the user is required to have acces to the (new) "Users are allowed to delete their own notes" permission:

<p align="center"><img class="wp-image-1113 size-full" src="http://freescout.shop/wp-content/uploads/edd/2022/05/screen.permissions.png" alt="FreeScout user permissions dialog with new &quot;Users are allowed to delete their own notes&quot; option." width="600" height="318" />
<br/><small><em>Not all users have to be able to delete notes.</em></small>
</p>

When the permission is granted, a new entry in the thread dropdown menu will appear:

<p align="center">
<img class="wp-image-1134 size-full" src="http://freescout.shop/wp-content/uploads/edd/2022/05/screen.menu_.png" alt="A FreeScout note with the dropdown menu opened, displaying a new option to delete the note." width="600" height="274" />
<br/><small><em>How to delete a FreeScout note?</em></small>
</p>

And after a simple prompt - who would've guessed - the note is gone for good.
